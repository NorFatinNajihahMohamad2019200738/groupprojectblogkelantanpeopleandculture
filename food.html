			<p align="center"> KOPITIAM KITA </p>
			<p align="justify"> The restaurant name is so friendly that you feel as though the place does belong to you and everyone else. This place is well known to the locals for its’ roti titab, which is toasted bread that comes with a dollop of kaya and an egg. Personally I’ve never tasted anything like it but I loved it nevertheless. Besides that, it is the only restaurant which houses all the popular dishes available Kelantan. </p> 
			<p> One of the Kelantan famous food is Roti Titab. Until today, the bread is still prepared traditionally, grilled by fiery coal. The aroma that comes from the grill makes the bread taste unique. It comes topped with a perfect half-boiled egg, with coconut jam spread on each corner of the bread. You can taste the perfect sweet and savory match from the egg and the sweetness of the coconut jam.</p>



	<div align="center"><img src="images/Nasi Ulam Cikgu.jpg" alt ="Nasi Ulam Cikgu" width="300px"> </div>

	        <p align="center"> Nasi Ulam Cikgu </p>
	        <p align="justify"> This restaurant offers varieties of combo and also a la carte. This restaurant is also special because it is now the remains of Kelantan Royal Palace, and you can see the beautiful architecture there. If we feel like food in Kelantan is unhealthy and we feel guilty about our body, fret not! We can opt for Nasi Ulam if we want a healthier meal. Combined with several raw vegetables, paired with boiled fish dipped with budu (anchovies sauce), you will taste all the flavor in your mouth! Guilt-free. </p> 


	<div align="center"><img src="images/Kedai Kopi White House.jpg" alt ="Kedai Kopi White House" width="300px"> </div>

	        <p align="center"> Kedai Kopi White House </p>
	        <p align="justify"> I often confuse the name of White House Coffee with White Castle, for no reason. It made my friends sigh in exasperation whenever I tell them that we should try to visit this popular coffee spot in Kota Bharu. The one thing we need to know about White House is that their opening hours is hard to predict. We’ve personally been to Kota Bharu a few times and only managed to visit the coffee house twice. This place also serves Kelantan breakfast food, including coffee, toast, and half-boiled eggs. You can start your day here and fill up your fuel before having a tour on Kelantan. </p>
	        <p>If we happen to drive back during the day or night and see that it’s opened, my advice is to get in and order without having second thoughts. Their popular item on the menu is the oven baked roti bakar (toasted bread) with butter and jam, coupled with perfect half cooked eggs. Their signature coffee with milk is dark but not bitter in taste. It’s probably one of my favourites to drink in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. If interested we can go direct the place at Jalan Sultanah Zainab, 15050, Kota Bharu, Kelantan</p>


	<div align="center"><img src="images/Kedai Kopi Pokloh Milo Tonggeng.jpg" alt ="Kedai Kopi Pokloh Milo Tonggeng" width="300px"> </div>  

	        <p align="center"> Kedai Kopi Pokloh Milo Tonggeng </p>
	        <p align="justify"> This humble stall pulls in a big breakfast crowd, serving local favourites such as Nasi Dagang Ikan, Himpit Satay, Nasi Ayam Gulai, Nasi Kerabu Ayam Bakar at prices as low as RM 1.00 a packet. There weren’t that many seats, therefore the easy way to do this is to choose the food, order drinks and sit at the island area which faces the counter activity. Food served in packets are normal here in Kota Bharu and it makes for convenient eating experience for both customers and sellers. Once you’re done, we can chuck the paper wrap into the dustbin, pass the used utensils and glasses to the stall owners, and be on your way.
	        <p> But before we do that, don’t forget to order the main attraction from this stall which is the Milo Tonggeng drink. Watch them prepare this special drink as the Milo is knocked directly from the tin, giving it a powdery chocolate top. I love that it’s ‘kau’ (thick) and crunchy in taste. This is definitely the OG of Milo Dinosaurs everywhere. </p>
