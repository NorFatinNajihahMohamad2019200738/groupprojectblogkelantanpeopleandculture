	<h1>KELANTAN-People and Culture</h1>

	<div align="center"><img src="images/kelate.jpeg" alt ="KELANTAN" width="500px"></div>
	<p align="justify">Most people are quick to assume that there is nothing to do in Kelantan. It does not have that trendy blend of tradition and urbanity which so defines Penang or Melaka. It has no stunning skyscraper or city vibes like Kuala Lumpur. It has few forest reserves as beautiful as Pahang or East Malaysia. Nor is it an emerging destination like Perak’s capital city.<br>Overlooked for decades, the state quietly conceals a treasure trove of cultural gems behind her predominantly Islamic, rural complexion. Unlike most places in Malaysia, Kelantan is a time capsule that preserves various forms of Malay cultural heritage.</p>

			<p align="justify">Culture Center-Kelantan is hailed as the cultural haven of Malaysia. It is here, at the Cultural Centre or Gelanggang Seni that you can witness Kelantan's rich culture heritage. Watch giant kites chase each other playfully in the azure sky, see tops the size of dinner plates spin frantically for hours and listen to the rich resonant of the rebana ubi (drums). In the evenings, visitors can see cultural performances featuring traditional Malay music and Wayang Kulit. The cultural centre is open three times a week from March to October. The wayang kulit or shadow play, is a unique form of theatre inspired by the great Hindu epics, the Ramayana and MahabrataThe tok dalang manipulates the puppets (made from buffalo hide and mounted on rattan sticks) and modulates his voice to create drama and suspense. </p>

			<p align="center">FISHING VILLAGE</p>
			<p align= "justify">No visit to Kelantan would be complete without a trip to a fishing village dubbed "the soul of Malaysia's East Coast". Two of the most well-known villages are the Sabak Beach (approx. 14 km from Kota Bharu) and Kuala Besar (15 km from Kota Bharu).  If you wish to fully capture the moment, you should arrive no later than 2:30 pm when the boats laden with the day's catch are first spotted on the horizon. As they come ashore. their intricately carved prows are a riot of colours. Then the bargaining begins between wholesalers and the fishermen - a noisy but interesting ritual. You will also be able to witness other related activities such as fish-curing and the mending of nets.</p>

			<p align="center">SONGKET AND BATIK</p>
			<p align= "justify">A textile factory to see how local women work on two intricate textile art, the songket and batik. Songket is a handwoven textile embroidered with gold or silver threads, traditionally worn during formal ceremonies.Batik, on the other hand, uses a technique called wax-resist dyeing to produce beautiful floral motifs on the fabric. Both of these traditional textiles are only a part of Kelantan’s large cultural tapestry, and there are plenty more local handicrafts, trades and traditions out there that have yet to be highlighted as the state’s intangible attraction. </p>


    <div align="center"><img src="images/kayu.jpeg" alt ="The business of Wood" width="400px"> </div>

			<p align="center">THE BUSINESS OF WOOD</p>
			<p align= "justify">The carving process itself generally involves four stages, from a drawn or traced design to cutting the unwanted bits out to the actual carving and polishing up.  Time consuming procedures that takes a considerable amount of patience. But anything handcrafted is a one of a kind unique piece and well worth waiting out the creative process for. At the very least it’s worth watching some of the process in person. </p>
