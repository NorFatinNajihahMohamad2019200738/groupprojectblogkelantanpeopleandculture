	<h1>KELANTAN DARUL NAIM</h1>
	<p>Kelantan is primarily a Malay state with a population of about 1.6 million people, with approximately 7% of the population of Thai, Indian, and Chinese ancestry. Over time, the people of Kelantan have carefully preserved their customs, traditions, and craft skills. Adults engaging in activities such as flying giant kites or spinning giant tops may surprise you.<br>Kelantanese are known for their warmth and hospitality, and they exude an old-world charm that draws visitors in. It is, however, a strictly Islamic state, and visitors are advised to dress conservatively in order to avoid offending local sensibilities.</p>
